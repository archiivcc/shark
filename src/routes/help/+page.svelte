  <Paragraph>
    Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows
    easy conversion to HTML and other formats, and its syntax is influenced by Perl. Markdown is
    often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to
    create rich text using a plain text editor. Here I will teach you how to use markdown, both
    basic syntax and our custom site-specific syntax.
